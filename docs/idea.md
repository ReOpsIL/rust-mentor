A rust TUI application that will help me learn rust. The application should be able to:
1. Pick a random subject according to user-specified level (1 -> 10).
2. The random subject will be explained in details 5 to 10 lines
3. A few code snippest will be generated to explain the subject
4. Generate 1 to 5 small exercises so the use will be able to learn the subject firmly

Important: The application should generate the random subject out of RUST documents

The application should use LLM (OpenRouter) to implement the subject, example code, etc .. generation
